3. Weâ€™d love to hear from you and your experience in working with the technology during this hackathon, 
   positive or negative. Please provide any feedback on your experience with BigQuery AI.

Overall, the experience was incredibly positive and demonstrated the power of integrating complex AI 
capabilities directly into the SQL workflow.

POSITIVE EXPERIENCES:
- The `AI.GENERATE_TABLE` function is a game-changer. The ability to extract structured, nested data (like a knowledge graph) 
    from unstructured text with a single function is remarkably powerful and saved an immense amount of development time 
    compared to traditional parsing methods.

- The multimodal capabilities of `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` with Gemini were impressive, allowing for the analysis of both text and 
    technical diagrams within a single pipeline.

- The seamless integration between BigQuery, Object Tables, and Vertex AI models creates a very elegant and efficient serverless
     architecture.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT / SUGGESTIONS:
- The 5,000-row minimum for creating an IVF `VECTOR INDEX` presents a challenge for high-performance prototypes on smaller, 
    yet still significant, datasets. While direct scanning works, the inability to use an index on a dataset of ~2,500 rows 
    means a key performance feature cannot be demonstrated.

- Authentication for deployed apps was challenging due to the two separate identities involved: our app's service account 
    needs permission to use the connection, while the connection's own service account needs permission to call the AI model. 
    A more unified permission model for this pattern would be helpful.

- The process for generating Signed URLs for GCS objects referenced in BigQuery could be more tightly integrated, perhaps 
    through a built-in SQL function, to simplify the creation of links in external applications.
