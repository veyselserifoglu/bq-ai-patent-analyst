# Refactoring Impact Log

## File Renaming and Cleanup

### Files Renamed
- [x] `core/simple_dashboard_engine.py` → `core/dashboard.py`
- [x] `core/state/pure_state_manager.py` → `core/state/state_manager.py`
- [x] `SimpleDashboardEngine` class → `DashboardEngine` class
- [x] `PureStateManager` class → `StateManager` class

### Import Updates
- [x] Updated `main.py` imports to use new file names
- [x] Updated class instantiation in `main.py`
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility through core/state_manager.py export

## State Manager Refactoring

### Files That MUST Be Updated
- [ ] `core/state_manager.py` - Replace with interface + implementations
- [ ] `main.py` - Update StateManager instantiation  
- [ ] `core/simple_dashboard_engine.py` - Use interface instead of concrete class

### Files to Check After Changes
- [ ] Any test files for these components
- [ ] Any other files importing simple_dashboard_engine

### Changes Made
- [x] Created state interface (StateInterface)
- [x] Created pure state manager (PureStateManager) 
- [x] Created Streamlit adapter (StreamlitStateAdapter)
- [x] Replaced StateManager with clean implementation
- [x] Updated engine to use interface
- [x] Updated main.py injection

## Simple Dashboard Engine Refactoring

### Files That MUST Be Updated
- [x] `core/simple_dashboard_engine.py` - Separated business logic from UI rendering

### Changes Made to Engine
- [x] Extracted pure business methods (_get_overview_mode_data, _get_search_mode_data, _get_visualization_data)
- [x] Separated UI rendering methods (_render_*_ui)
- [x] Created clear coordinator methods (run, run_data_tab)
- [x] Maintained existing _get_search_results as pure business logic
- [x] Added documentation for testing strategy

## App Controller Refactoring

### Files That MUST Be Updated  
- [x] `core/app_controller.py` - Removed global dependencies, added configuration
- [x] `main.py` - Updated constructor call

### Changes Made to Controller
- [x] Removed global path manipulation (sys.path.append)
- [x] Removed environment dependencies (os.getenv)
- [x] Added AppConfig dataclass for dependency injection
- [x] Updated constructor to accept configuration
- [x] Fixed all project_id references to use config
- [x] Added environment factory method for production use
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation

## Visualization Service Refactoring

### Files That MUST Be Updated
- [x] `services/visualization_service.py` - Removed global path manipulation
- [x] `main.py` - Removed global path manipulation

### Changes Made to Services
- [x] Removed sys.path.append from visualization service
- [x] Removed sys.path.append from main.py
- [x] Clean imports without path manipulation
- [x] All path manipulation eliminated from codebase

### Testing Benefits Achieved
- [x] No global state modifications
- [x] Clean import structure
- [x] Services no longer modify Python path
- [x] Ready for proper package structure
